# examWP - XRAY's website Files
This repository holds files from our project of brand refreshment and storyscaping for Harboe's XRAY
The website is built on wordpress and Bootstrap and consists of 2 themes
### For Teachers:
There are many problems and inconsistencies on the website which will be addressed in the following few weeks before Jun 21st.

Those inconsistencies are as follows:

1.Broken layout on some pages because of certain design choices that need to be either addressed or dropped,

2.Website doesn't clearly represent XRAY energy drink on the first glance, rather just a regular blog

3.Performance issues and some elements that should be hidden on mobile

4.The blog section(Drink inspiration) is not clearly put together like a blog

#### Planned extra functionality:
Design your own XRAY Flavour or Can game

Database connection to save the design data

Plugin to display the results of designed cans

JS carousel to promote the design-your-can game and the new storyscaping video
